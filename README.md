# E-health

E-health is a web application designed to manage patient and doctor health information. It provides dedicated dashboards for both patients and doctors, facilitating telemedicine and enabling online appointment scheduling.

## Features

-   Online appointment scheduling: Search for a specialty, choose a practitioner, and select a convenient time slot for your appointment. Connect to the virtual waiting room 15 minutes before the teleconsultation starts.
